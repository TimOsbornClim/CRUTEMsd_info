Table of Quality Codes used in CRUTEM station database

A six-digit quality code is used in version CRUTEMsd.5.1 and later.

Flag values that are non-zero indicate some concern over the reliability of the value.

Flag values that are zero do not indicate that the value is reliability.
Due to the limited scope of our checks, we are unable to provide such a warranty.


Digit 1 -- manually flagged values (individually or as part of a block)

0:
No concerns have been raised

1:
Part of a block of values at the start of the timeseries that may be unreliable because they are before the first values considered to be reliable.

2:
Part of a block of values later in the timeseries that appear to be unreliable.

3:
An individual value that appears to be unreliable.

4-9:
Reserved for future expansion.


Digit 2 -- statistically flagged as physically implausible

0:
The value lies within the physically plausible range.

1:
The value lies below the physically plausible range.

2:
The value lies above the physically plausible range.

3-9:
Reserved for future expansion.


Digit 3 -- statistically flagged as potential outliers

0:
The value passed statistical outlier checks.

1:
The value appears to be a cold outlier.

2:
The value appears to be a warm outlier.
